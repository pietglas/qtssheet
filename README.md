Files for a simple spreadsheet in Qt. 

The aim of this project is for me to extend my C++ skills and familiarize myself with the Qt-framework. As such, their is not much documentation yet, the real world use is very limited and there might be several bugs.

I used the following sources to get started with Qt:
- https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qtbase.git/tree/examples/widgets/itemviews/spreadsheet?h=5.14
- https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/modelview.html 

My approach for parsing and evaluating formulas is based on Chapter 19 of the following course reader: 
- http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106x/res/reader/CS106BX-Reader.pdf 

To do: 
- Put the formula-functionality in a toolbar to make it more user friendly
- add formulas like sum of several cells, mean, etc.
